# Factory-Energy-Optimization-Simulator
A simulation tool that models factory operations to optimize energy consumption using AI algorithms, reducing costs and improving sustainability.

A browser-based simulator that models energy usage within a factory environment and applies AI-inspired heuristics to optimize energy consumption. It visualizes energy savings over time using interactive charts.

## 🌟 Features

- Simulates 14 days of hourly factory operation data
- Visualizes baseline vs optimized energy usage using Chart.js
- Models real-world variables like:
  - External temperature
  - Occupancy level
  - Solar energy availability
  - Machine and HVAC power consumption
- Uses simple AI logic (heuristic-based simulation):
  - Idle machine detection
  - HVAC power optimization
  - Solar-driven scheduling
